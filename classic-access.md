# Setting up access to your Classic Infrastructure from VPC
{: #setting-up-access-to-your-classic-infrastructure-from-vpc}
[comment]: # (linked help topic)

You may set up access to your {{site.data.keyword.cloud}} Classic Infrastructure, including Direct Link connectivity, from one VPC in each region. These special "Classic Access VPCs" use the same routing capability (implicit router) as your {{site.data.keyword.cloud}} classic infrastructure. Readers are expected to be familiar with Classic Infrastructure networking.

When you've set up a VPC for classic access, every compute host (VSI or Bare Metal) without a public interface in your classic account can send and receive packets to and from the classic access VPC. However, remember that firewalls, gateways, Network ACLs, or security groups can filter this traffic. As a best practice, we recommend that you allow only the traffic that's required for your applications to function properly.

In classic account hosts with a public interface, you must add a route that points back to your Classic-enabled VPC. This route must include the subnets of your Classic-enabled VPC as a destination and the gateway address for traffic that leaves the private interface of the host as the next hop.
{: important}

## Pre-requisites:
{: #vpc-prerequisites}

1. Your classic account must be linked to your IBM Cloud account. See [Linking IBMid accounts](/docs/account?topic=account-unifyingaccounts) for instructions on how to do this.
1. Your classic account must be enabled for VRF.
    * If you already have Direct Link on your account, you are ready.
    * If your account is not VRF-enabled, open an IBM Support case to request "VRF Migration" for your account. See [Converting to VRF](#vrf-conversion) to learn more about the conversion process.

Firewalls, gateways, Network ACLs, or security groups can filter out some or all of the network traffic between Classic and VPC resources.
{: important}

All subnets in a VPC with classic access will be shared into the Classic Infrastructure VRF, which uses IP addresses in the `10.0.0.0/8` space. To avoid IP address conflicts, it is recommended that you do not use IP addresses in the `10.0.0.0/14`, `10.200.0.0/14`, `10.198.0.0/15`, and `10.254.0.0/16` blocks. In addition,
you should not use addresses from your classic infrastructure subnets. To view the list of your classic infrastructure subnets, see [View all Subnets](/docs/subnets?topic=subnets-view-all-subnets).
{: important}

## Create a Classic Access VPC
{: #create-a-classic-access-vpc}

You can create a VPC with Classic Access capability by using the User Interface (UI), Command Line Interface (CLI), or Application Programming Interface (API).

A VPC must be set up for Classic Access when it's created: you cannot update a VPC to add or remove the Classic Access capability.
{: note}

### Create a Classic Access VPC from the User Interface
{: #create-a-classic-access-vpc-from-the-user-interface}

Create a Classic Access VPC from the **Create VPC** page, by clicking on the checkbox titled **Enable access to classic resource**, under the **Classic access** label.

![classic-access-ui](/images/classic-access-ui.png)

### Create a Classic Access VPC using the CLI
{: #create-a-classic-access-vpc-using-the-cli}

Use the flag `--classic-access` when creating the VPC. For example,

```
ibmcloud is vpc-create my-access-vpc --classic-access
```
{: pre}


### Create a Classic Access VPC using the API
{: #create-a-classic-access-vpc-using-the-api}

Pass in the `classic_access` parameter when creating the VPC. For example,

```bash
curl -X POST "$rias_endpoint/v1/vpcs?version=2019-05-31&generation=1" \
  -H "Authorization: $iam_token" \
  -d '{
        "name": "my-access-vpc",
        "classic_access": true
      }'
```
{: pre}


### Classic Access VPC default address prefixes
{: #classic-access-default-address-prefixes}

All subnets in a VPC with classic access will be shared into the Classic Infrastructure VRF, which uses IP addresses in the `10.0.0.0/8` space. To avoid IP address conflicts, **do not use** IP addresses on the `10.0.0.0/8` space when creating subnets in a Classic Access VPC.
{: important}

When a new Classic Access VPC is created, the default address prefixes are assigned, based on the region and zone, as shown in the table that follows:

Zone         | Address Prefix
---------------|---------------
`us-south-1`   | `172.16.0.0/18`
`us-south-2`   | `172.16.64.0/18`
`us-south-3`   | `172.16.128.0/18`
`us-east-1`    | `172.17.0.0/18`
`us-east-2`    | `172.17.64.0/18`
`us-east-3`    | `172.17.128.0/18`
`eu-gb-1`      | `172.18.0.0/18`
`eu-gb-2`      | `172.18.64.0/18`
`eu-gb-3`      | `172.18.128.0/18`
`eu-de-1`      | `172.19.0.0/18`
`eu-de-2`      | `172.19.64.0/18`
`eu-de-3`      | `172.19.128.0/18`
`jp-tok-1`     | `172.20.0.0/18`
`jp-tok-2`     | `172.20.64.0/18`
`jp-tok-3`     | `172.20.128.0/18`
`au-syd-1`     | `172.21.0.0/18`
`au-syd-2`     | `172.21.64.0/18`
`au-syd-3`     | `172.21.128.0/18`

## Converting your account to VRF
{: #vrf-conversion}

The VRF conversion process involves a network disruption while the VLANs and their subnets are detached from the ACL backbone and then attached to the _Customer VRF_. This process results in a few moments of packet loss for traffic entering or exiting the VLANs. Packets within the VLAN continue to flow. In the cases where a network gateway, such as a FortiGate Security Appliance or Virtual Router Appliance is involved, no disruption occurs among the VLANs attached to that gateway. The servers see no network outage themselves, and most workloads automatically recover when the traffic flow resumes. The total duration of the disruption depends on the extent of the tenant’s topology, that is, the number of subnets, VLANs, and pods that your tenancy includes.

During migration, the VLANs are disconnected from the backbone and reconnected to the _Customer VRF_.  The duration of disruption varies, depending on the quantity of VLANs, PODs, and data centers involved. Traffic among VLANs is disrupted, yet the servers stay connected to the network. The application may or may not be affected, depending on its sensitivity to packet loss.

### How to initiate VRF conversion
{: #how-you-can-initiate-the-conversion}

To request conversion of your account to VRF, follow these steps:

1. [Open a support case](https://cloud.ibm.com/unifiedsupport/cases/add){: external} through the {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} console.
1. Select "Technical" for the type of support needed and "VPC Network" for the category.
1. Enter "Convert account to VRF for VPC Classic Access" as the subject.
1. For the description, enter the following text:
   "We are requesting that account _your account number_ is moved to its own VRF. We understand the risks and approve the change. Please reply with the scheduled window(s) of time where this change will be made so we can prepare for the migration."

Migration is completed by the {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} Network Engineering team. No other information is required from you, except an agreed-to schedule. Typically, packet loss might last 15 - 30 minutes, depending on the complexity of your account. It might be longer if your account has legacy Direct Link connections. The process is highly automated, requiring minimal interaction by the IBM team, and it should be transparent.

## Limitations
{: #vpc-limitations}

* Only your private (or "backend" in old documentation) networks will be connected to your account's private implicit router.
* Only subnets allocated to your classic infrastructure with IBM Cloud provisioning systems are connected to the classic side of your private implicit router.
* Only one VPC per region, per account can be enabled for Classic Access.
* If your classic infrastructure includes an imported default route from Direct Link, the imported default route is used by your Classic Access VPC. In this scenario, the public gateway and floating IPs in your Classic Access VPC will not provide internet access. Once the default route is no longer imported via Direct Link, then public gateways and floating IPs will once again provide internet access.

Depending on the OS you've installed on your classic VSIs or bare metal servers, your configuration procedure will vary. For more information, see [About public virtual servers](/docs/vsi?topic=virtual-servers-about-public-virtual-servers).
