# Known limitations
{: #known-limitations}

This document contains a summary of features and APIs that are not supported, features and use cases not yet supported, known issues in the current release, and a list of features offered as Beta services only. Known limitations might change as we add capabilities to {{site.data.keyword.vpc_full}} (VPC), so feel free to check back with this document from time to time.

## Summary of features not supported
{: #summary-of-features-not-supported}

* Direct Link on Classic access to VPC is supported through [**Classic Access**](/docs/vpc-on-classic?topic=vpc-on-classic-setting-up-access-to-your-classic-infrastructure-from-vpc) only. [Direct Link (release 2.0)](/docs/dl?topic=dl-get-started-with-ibm-cloud-dl) does not have this limitation. 
* Although a subset of Private Service Endpoints are available to VPC, not all endpoints are available. See [Service endpoints available for IBM Cloud VPC](/docs/vpc-on-classic?topic=vpc-on-classic-service-endpoints-available-for-ibm-cloud-vpc) for services that are available.
* Saving and restoring images is not supported.
* {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} VPCs are regional, therefore a VPC from one region cannot connect to a VPC in another region unless they are "classic access" enabled, or connected by means of a VPN connection. See [**Classic Access**](/docs/vpc-on-classic?topic=vpc-on-classic-setting-up-access-to-your-classic-infrastructure-from-vpc).

## Features and use cases not yet supported
{: #features-and-use-cases-not-yet-supported}

This section lists more details of unsupported features and use cases, categorized according to their {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} service.

### Virtual Private Cloud
{: vpc-unsupported-features-and-use-cases}

* {{site.data.keyword.vpc_short}} does not support multicast or broadcast domains.
* {{site.data.keyword.vpc_short}} does not provide end-to-end encryption.
* A VPC cannot be peered with other VPCs natively. It is possible to connect VPCs utilizing either Transit Gateway, VPN Gateways or Floating IPs. 
    - With both VPN Gateways and Floating IPs, there is no automatic route advertisement between the two VPCs. Static routes must be used in each VPC to enable layer 3 connectivity between the two VPCs. See [How to use a VPN Gateway to connect two VPCs](/docs/vpc-on-classic-network?topic=vpc-on-classic-network---using-vpn-with-your-vpc#vpn-example) for how you can achieve VPC-to-VPC connectivity using this method. 
    - With Transit Gateway, it advertises the root subnets of each VPC allowing trafific to be routed without the use of static routes. For more information see [Getting started with IBM Cloud Transit Gateway](/docs/transit-gateway?topic=transit-gateway-getting-started)
* Cloud Service Endpoints are not supported by VPC. See [Service endpoints available for IBM Cloud VPC](/docs/vpc-on-classic?topic=vpc-on-classic-service-endpoints-available-for-ibm-cloud-vpc) for services that are available.

### Compute
{: VSI-unsupported-features-and-use-cases}

* Existing {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} bare metal servers cannot be migrated into a VPC.
* Bare metal servers cannot be provisioned in a VPC.
* {{site.data.keyword.vsi_is_short}} have different naming conventions than classic infrastructure virtual server instances. For example, an instance name must start with a lowercase letter. Instance names cannot begin with numbers or dashes. For more information about naming instances, see the error message for [instance_invalid_hostname](/docs/vpc-on-classic?topic=vpc-on-classic-rias-error-messages#instance_invalid_hostname).

### Network
{: network-unsupported-features-and-use-cases}

* A subnet cannot be on multiple zones.
* A subnet cannot be moved from one zone to another.
* Subnets cannot be resized after they are created.
* {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} Classic resources cannot be in the same subnet in a VPC. Connectivity between classic resources and one VPC in your account is possible using [**Classic Access**](/docs/vpc-on-classic?topic=vpc-on-classic-setting-up-access-to-your-classic-infrastructure-from-vpc).
* IPv6 is not supported.
* You cannot use your own public IP as a Floating IP. The Floating IP pool is provided by IBM.
* A Floating IP is bound to a zone. For example, a Floating IP reserved from a pool in Zone 1 cannot be assigned to a VSI in Zone 2 in the same VPC.
* Private IP addresses cannot be moved between VSIs.
* Network interfaces cannot be moved between VSIs.
* You cannot designate the specific IP address of the VSI. You can only specify the IP range for the subnet. Once you attach a VSI to a subnet, the system assigns a private IP from that subnet.
* {{site.data.keyword.vpc_short}} comes with its own Network as a Service tools such as LBaaS, ACLs, and security groups. You cannot use your own network appliances (for example, a Vyatta Gateway or other load balancer) to control any resource in the VPC. Similarily, you cannot use your own load balancer or security groups services in {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} Classic Infrastructure to control resources in the {{site.data.keyword.vpc_short}}.
* The public gateway does not allow the traffic to be initiated from the Internet to a VSI in the IBM Cloud VPC. For that purpose, a Floating IP must be used.
* ACL is stateless, so return traffic must be allowed explicitly in ACL rules.
